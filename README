GLEE USB GRUB2 Multi-Boot
=========================

The following instructions assume your USB drive is mounted on /mnt, so adjust
accordingly. My experience has been that the safest filesystem to use is FAT32
(surprisingly!), though it will mean that ISO images greater than 4GB won't be
supported.


Install GRUB2 to the USB device's MBR :

grub2-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdd

Errors and solutions :
 * "source_dir doesn't exist. Please specify --target or --directory"
   Find your grub2 directory and specify it. Example :
   --directory=/usr/lib/grub/i386-pc
 * --force : If your partitions start at 63 instead of more, such as 2048


Copy over the grub.cfg file as well as the theme it uses :

rsync -avP grub2/ /mnt/boot/grub2


Now create and populate the /mnt/boot/iso/ sub-directories. Example :

iso/gparted:
 gparted-live-0.14.0-1.iso
iso/ipxe:
 ipxe.iso
iso/sysrescd:
 systemrescuecd-x86-3.0.0.iso
iso/ubuntu:
 ubuntu-12.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso
 ubuntu-12.04.1-desktop-i386.iso
 ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64.iso
 ubuntu-12.10-desktop-i386.iso

The supported sub-directories are :
arch debian fedora gparted ipxe knoppix linuxmint rhel sysrescd ubuntu

Any missing sub-directory will have the matching boot menu entry automatically
disabled, so to skip any distribution(s), just don't create its directory.

If you require different versions, or just part of a distributions, edit the
appropriate inc-*.cfg file.

Note that on 32bit computers, all 64bit entries will be automatically disabled.

Fedora Live ISOs require a patched initrd to work (still as of Fedora 17) :
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=650672
https://gist.github.com/2132076

To create the required initrd files (about 15MB each), as root :

./fedora-fromiso /mnt/boot/iso/fedora/Fedora-17-i686-Live-Desktop.iso /mnt/boot/iso/fedora/Fedora-17-i686-initrd.img
./fedora-fromiso /mnt/boot/iso/fedora/Fedora-17-x86_64-Live-Desktop.iso /mnt/boot/iso/fedora/Fedora-17-x86_64-initrd.img


Test your bootable GRUB2 USB memory :

With KVM it should "just work". The /dev/sdx device should be configured as
an IDE or SATA disk (for some reason, as USB disk didn't work for me on Fedora
17), that way you can easily and quickly test changes.
Make sure you unmount the disk from the host OS before you start the KVM
virtual machine that uses it.


If you have any problem to boot, for instance stuck at the GRUB prompt before
the menu, try running grub-install again.
If you have other exotic GRUB errors, try formatting your USB memory with a
different filesystem. I've had the most luck with FAT32...
