Install GRUB2 to the USB device's MBR :

grub2-install --force --boot-directory=/run/media/dude/DT200/boot /dev/sdd

Errors and solutions :
 * "source_dir doesn't exist. Please specify --target or --directory"
   Find your grub2 directory and specify it. Example :
   --directory=/usr/lib/grub/i386-pc
 * --force : If your partitions start at 63 instead of more, such as 2048


Copy over the grub.cfg file as well as the theme it uses :

rsync -avP grub2/ /run/media/dude/DT200/boot/grub2


Now create and populate the boot/files/ and iso/ directories. Example :

/mnt/boot/files:
sysrescd

/mnt/iso:
gparted-live-0.14.0-1.iso
ipxe.iso
rhel-server-6.3-x86_64-boot.iso
systemrescuecd-x86-3.0.0.iso
ubuntu-12.04-desktop-amd64.iso
ubuntu-12.04-desktop-i386.iso

For Fedora Live ISOs to work without extracting their content, see :

As root (for the loopback mount to work) :

./fedora-fromiso /mnt/iso/Fedora-17-i686-Live-Desktop.iso /mnt/boot/files/Fedora-17-i686-initrd.img
./fedora-fromiso /mnt/iso/Fedora-17-x86_64-Live-Desktop.iso /mnt/boot/files/Fedora-17-x86_64-initrd.img


Test your bootable GRUB2 USB memory :

With KVM it should "just work". The /dev/sdx device should be configured as
an IDE or SATA disk (for some reason, as USB disk didn't work for me on Fedora
17), that way you can easily and quickly test changes.
Make sure you unmount the disk from the host OS before you start the KVM
virtual machine that uses it.
